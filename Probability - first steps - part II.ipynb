    "# A public health agency is studying vaccination uptake and disease outcomes among adults in a community. \n",
    "# They track two factors for each individual:\n",
    "# 1) Exposure to Public Health Campaigns (the number of informational mailers or announcements they’ve received about the vaccine).\n",
    "# 2) Prior Health Condition (whether the person has a pre-existing risk factor, like diabetes).\n",
    "# They suspect these two factors might look independent at first glance, \n",
    "# but could become conditionally dependent when one accounts for the individual’s overall health awareness. \n",
    "# They also want to train a simple model to predict who ultimately contracts the disease, \n",
